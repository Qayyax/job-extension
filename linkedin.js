// Here is where I want to parse the data
// I still need to know what background.js does
// lets try this with linkedin
const jobDescription = document.querySelector(".jobs-description__container");
console.log(jobDescription.textContent);
// https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/collections/
// So I think I would break it down instead, would make for linkedin, make for indeed
// and leave it open source for future contributions
